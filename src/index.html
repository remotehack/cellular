        Conway's game of life:
         - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
         - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
         - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
         - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

        Forest fire model:
         - A burning cell turns into an empty cell
         - A tree will burn if at least one neighbor is burning
         - A tree ignites with probability f even if no neighbor is burning
         - An empty space fills with a tree with probability p
